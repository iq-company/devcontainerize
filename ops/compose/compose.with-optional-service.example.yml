# Example: How to add optional services to your compose setup
#
# 1. Copy this file and rename it (e.g., compose.with-ocr-ext.yml)
# 2. Define your service with a profile (so it doesn't start by default)
# 3. Add a reference to your file in compose.base.yml:
#    include:
#      - ./compose.with-your-service.yml
#      - ./compose.${DBMS:-postgres}.yml
#
# 4. Start with profile: docker compose --profile sample up
#
# Services with profiles only start when explicitly requested.
# See: https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/

services:
  sample-service:
    profiles:
      - sample
    image: alpine:latest
    command: echo "Sample service running"
    # build: ../build/resources/sample_extensions  # Or build from Dockerfile in ops/build/docker/
