# Stage Configuration for {{ project_name }}
# Manage with: bench ops stage ls|show|add|rm|run|stop|clean|build

# =============================================================================
# Apps to install in images (order matters!)
# =============================================================================
# These are the DEFAULT apps built into the base dev/release images.
# Stages can override refs or ignore apps - but that requires a separate image build.

apps:
  - name: frappe
    source: https://github.com/frappe/frappe
    ref: {{ frappe_ref }}

  - name: {{ app_name }}
    source: local
    ref: HEAD

# =============================================================================
# Stage Definitions
# =============================================================================
# Stages define runtime environments and their relationship to build targets.
#
# Properties:
#   - target: baker-cli build target (REQUIRED, e.g., dev, release, release-alpine)
#   - env_file: .env file to use (relative to ops/env/)
#   - compose_file: Compose entry point (default: compose.base.yml)
#   - profiles: compose profiles to activate:
#               - db: Database service (postgres/mariadb)
#               - redis: Redis cache and queue services
#               - stack: Production services (backend, frontend, workers)
#               - webdb: Database admin UI
#               These are COMBINED with COMPOSE_PROFILES from .env (not overwritten)
#   - extends: inherit from another stage (inherits target if not overridden)
#
# Image source (where to pull the image from):
#   - image: Full image reference to pull (e.g., ghcr.io/org/repo/app-dev:latest)
#            If not set, expects a locally built image (see: bench ops stage build)
#            This is independent from the push registry used during builds.
#
# App customization (requires separate image):
#   - apps: override app refs or ignore apps
#   - image_suffix: REQUIRED when apps differ from base (e.g., -staging)
#
# The relationship between stages and build targets:
#
#   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
#   │ BUILD TARGETS (baker-cli)         │ STAGES (runtime)                │
#   ├───────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
#   │ dev        → Development image    │ dev     → Local development     │
#   │ release    → Production image     │ staging → Staging environment   │
#   │ release-alpine → Minimal image    │ prod    → Production            │
#   └───────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘
#
# IMPORTANT: If a stage customizes `apps`, it needs its own image!
#   - Set `image_suffix` to create a distinct image name
#   - `bench ops stage build <stage>` will build with stage-specific apps

stages:
  # Development stage - used by VSCode devcontainer
  # Uses dev image with local DB and Redis services
  dev:
    target: dev
    env_file: .env.dev
    profiles:                           # These are combined with COMPOSE_PROFILES from .env
      - db
      - redis
      - init
    # image: ghcr.io/your-org/{{ app_name }}/{{ image_prefix }}-dev:latest
    # ↑ Uncomment to pull pre-built image from registry (for new team members).
    #   Without this, the image ({{ image_prefix }}-dev) must be built locally using: bench ops stage build dev

# =============================================================================
# Example additional stages (uncomment and customize)
# =============================================================================
#
#  # Local stage - run release image locally with all services
#  # Useful for testing the production image before deployment
#  local:
#    target: release
#    env_file: .env.local
#    profiles:
#      - db
#      - redis
#      - stack
#
#  # Staging - uses release image with external services
#  staging:
#    target: release
#    env_file: .env.staging
#    profiles:
#      - stack                       # Only stack, external DB/Redis
#
#  # Production - pins specific app versions (requires separate image)
#  prod:
#    extends: staging                # Inherits target and profiles from staging
#    env_file: .env.prod
#    image_suffix: -prod             # REQUIRED: creates {{ image_prefix }}-release-prod
#    apps:
#      - name: frappe
#        ref: v15.47.0               # Pin to specific version
#      - name: {{ app_name }}
#        ref: v1.0.0                 # Pin to release tag
